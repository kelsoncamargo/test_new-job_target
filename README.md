2) Given the Fibonacci sequence, where it starts with 0 and 1 and the next value will always be the sum of the 2 previous values (example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34. ..), write a program in the language you want where, given a number, it calculates the Fibonacci sequence and returns a message letting you know whether or not the number entered belongs to the sequence.

IMPORTANT:
This number can be informed through any input of your choice or it can be previously defined in the code;


3) Given a vector that stores the daily billing value of a distributor, make a program, in the language you want, that calculates and returns:
• The lowest billing amount that occurred on a day of the month;
• The highest billing amount occurred on a day of the month;
• Number of days in the month that the daily billing amount was higher than the monthly average.

IMPORTANT:
a) Use available json or xml as a source of monthly billing data;
b) There may be days without billing, such as weekends and holidays. These days should be ignored when calculating the average;


4) Given the monthly billing value of a distributor, broken down by state:

SP - BRL 67,836.43
RJ - BRL 36,678.66
MG - BRL 29,229.88
ES - BRL 27,165.48
Others - BRL 19,849.53

Write a program in the language you want where it calculates the percentage of representation that each state had within the total monthly value of the distributor.

5) Write a program that reverses the characters of a string.

IMPORTANT:
a) This string can be entered through any entry of your choice or can be previously defined in the code;
b) Avoid using ready-made functions, such as reverse;
